/// Similar to [ShellRoute], this route class places its sub-route on a
/// different Navigator than the root Navigator. However, this route class
/// differs in that it creates separate Navigators for each of its nested
/// branches (i.e. parallel navigation trees), making it possible to build an
/// app with stateful nested navigation. This is convenient when for instance
/// implementing a UI with a [BottomNavigationBar], with a persistent navigation
/// state for each tab.
///
/// A StatefulShellRoute is created by specifying a List of [StatefulShellBranch]
/// items, each representing a separate stateful branch in the route tree.
/// StatefulShellBranch provides the root routes and the Navigator key ([GlobalKey])
/// for the branch, as well as an optional default location.
///
/// Like [ShellRoute], a [builder] and [pageBuilder] can be provided when
/// creating a StatefulShellRoute. However, StatefulShellRoute differs in that
/// the builder is mandatory and the pageBuilder may optionally be used in
/// addition to the builder. The reason for this is that the builder function is
/// not used to generate the final Widget used to represent the
/// StatefulShellRoute. Instead, the returned Widget will only form part of the
/// stateful navigation shell for this route. This means that the role of the
/// [builder] is to provide part of the navigation shell, whereas the role of
/// [pageBuilder] is simply to customize the Page used for this route (see
/// example below).
///
/// In the builder function, the child parameter is a Widget that contains - and is
/// responsible for managing - the Navigators for the different route branches
/// of this StatefulShellRoute. This widget is meant to be used as the body of a
/// custom shell implementation, for example as the body of [Scaffold] with a
/// [BottomNavigationBar].
///
/// The state of a StatefulShellRoute is represented by
/// [StatefulShellRouteState], which can be accessed by calling
/// [StatefulShellRouteState.of]. This state object exposes information such
/// as the current branch index, the state of the route branches etc. The state
/// object also provides support for changing the active branch, i.e. restoring
/// the navigation stack of another branch. This is accomplished using the
/// method [StatefulShellRouteState.goBranch], and providing either a Navigator
/// key, branch name or branch index. For example:
///
/// ```
/// void _onBottomNavigationBarItemTapped(BuildContext context, int index) {
///   final StatefulShellRouteState shellState = StatefulShellRouteState.of(context);
///   shellState.goBranch(index: index);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Sometimes greater control is needed over the layout and animations of the
/// Widgets representing the branch Navigators. In such cases, the child
/// argument in the builder function can be ignored, and a custom implementation
/// can instead be built using the child widgets of the branches
/// (see [StatefulShellRouteState.children]) directly. For example:
///
/// ```
/// final StatefulShellRouteState shellState = StatefulShellRouteState.of(context);
/// final int currentIndex = shellState.currentIndex;
/// final List<Widget> children = shellRouteState.children;
/// return MyCustomShell(currentIndex, children);
/// ```
///
/// Below is a simple example of how a router configuration with
/// StatefulShellRoute could be achieved. In this example, a
/// BottomNavigationBar with two tabs is used, and each of the tabs gets its
/// own Navigator. A container widget responsible for managing the Navigators
/// for all route branches will then be passed as the child argument
/// of the builder function.
///
